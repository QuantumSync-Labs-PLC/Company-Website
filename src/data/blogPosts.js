      "Discover how QuantumSync Labs uses advanced AI to enhance security in digital banking platforms, safeguarding transactions and building trust.",
    content: `
      <p>
        At <strong>QuantumSync Labs</strong>, we believe robust digital banking security is the foundation of trust in the financial sector. As threats evolve, our next-generation AI platform delivers the vigilance and agility banks need to protect their users and reputation.
      </p>
      <h2>Our AI Security Approach</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Always-on anomaly detection, learning from each transaction to block emerging threats instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Encryption:</strong> End-to-end encryption and biometric authentication (face, fingerprint, voice) for uncompromising protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Distress & Social Engineering Detection:</strong> Analyze user sentiment, typing speed, and navigation to spot forced logins or scams.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud Risk Scoring:</strong> Machine learning models assign real-time risk to every action, triggering step-up authentication when needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Results & Real-World Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Our partners report <strong>40% fewer fraudulent transactions</strong>, faster response times, and increased customer confidence. <br>
        We work closely with compliance teams to ensure full auditability (GDPR, PCI DSS, ISO 27001), and our AI adapts as threats evolve.
      </p>
